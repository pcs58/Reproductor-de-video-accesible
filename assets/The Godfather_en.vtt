00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have known each other for years, and for the first time he asks me for help.

two
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I don't remember the last time you bought me a cup of coffee.

3
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.000
And that my wife is the godmother of your daughter.

4
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:22.000
But let's be frank. You never wanted my friendship.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.500
And you were scared of being in debt.

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000
I didn't want to commit.

7
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:32.000
I get it

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Your paradise was America.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.500
Life was going well for you, the police protected you and there were courts of justice.

10
00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:45.353
You don't need a friend like me.

eleven
00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:49.566
But now you come to me to say:

12
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.069
Don Corleone, do justice.

13
00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.824
But you don't ask respectfully.

14
00:00:57.907 --> 00:01:01.620
He does not offer friendship. You don't even call me Godfather.
